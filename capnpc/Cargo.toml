# Don't include "std" feature, so that dependent crates can include a build-time
# capnpc dependency still use capnp with no-std.
#
# This might not be necessary in the future, if cargo supports separate feature sets for
# build and main dependencies: https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/issues/7915
#
# Doing this forces capnpc to define its own mapping from std::io::Read to capnp::io::Read.
# Fortunately, this is pretty easy, and is just an internal implementation detail.
