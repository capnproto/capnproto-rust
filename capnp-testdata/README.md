Don't use this crate.  It is an implementation detail of capnp, which
exists due to limitations in cargo's build system.

This crate contains test data, which is used by capnp's documentation
tests.  This test data is generated by capnpc.  capnp can't generate
the test data itself, because that would create a dependency cycle
(capnp -> capnpc -> capnp).  Note: capnp can't declare capnpc to be a
dev dependency, because we need to run it from build.rs.  This
external crate allows us to break the cycle.
